# Danimator-UnFuckUp-Script
## Made for use with [Danimator](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=49494)!
## Instructions
* Edit the bottom of the Python script to contain offsets formatted as so:
```
Offset(X, Y, SpriteX, SpriteY)
```
  * `X` and `Y` should be the same as they are in Danimator.
  * `SpriteX` and `SpriteY` should be the same as the sprite offsets in [SLADE](https://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=downloads).
* Then, run the script. You should be able to copy the offsets for use with the PK3.
