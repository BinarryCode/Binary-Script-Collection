# "Mus_Loop" - Music Looper made for Zandronum or other ZDoom forks.
## Requires [PyMusicLooper](https://github.com/arkrow/PyMusicLooper#installation)!
## Instructions
* Drag and drop music files into the .Bat file, or in Command Prompt:
```
Mus_Loop.bat (music file names, separated by spaces)
```
* Then, run the script. After a while, it should output audio files that are automatically looped.
* You can probably compress the audio further in Audacity if you want to.
